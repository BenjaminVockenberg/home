                p   I'm able to start web app projects from scratch using modern frameworks like 
                    strong Angular, React and VueJS. 
                    | I like unit testing, Git and process automation such as gulp and webpack. I also like TypeScript and ES6 a lot. I know how to make responsive websites and apps with or without frameworks.

                p I love Javascript because it is best for learning and using functional programming. The features of ES6 are awesome. But in order to create big scaled web applications It is good to know you can count on lots of helping hands. Framesworks can handle lots of stuff you would have take care of by your self. There are many frameworks out there, but I prefer using Angular for more complex applications and VueJs for more or less simpler projects.

                p Many people are using the framework for each project, cause they are happy to do so. But I love to have the possibility to have a more lightweight framework for more lightweight a like Projects. Vue is the best choice for smaller applications. Some people would ask now: 
                    span what about React'n'stuff? 
                    | Yeah React is cool, but I prefer to keep my smaller projects as simple as possible. If you never took a look to Vue, you definitely should do so.
