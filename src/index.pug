                    h2  Hi, I'm Ben...
                    
                    p   simply Ben but my real name is Benjamin Vockenberg. I'm working as a fontend developer in Frankfurt, Germany. I'm doing dev-stuff for the Internet since 2007 as I leared how much fun it is to get things moved into the world wide web and earning money with it. 
                    
                    p   I also earned a lot of experience at the companies I worked for. Mostly I worked for advertisement agencies but I learned to use the most common web technologies there... Like HTML, CSS,Javascript, PHP, SQl... 
                    
                    p Then later in order to get my skills improved I learned how to create applications using the newest technologies like HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS and Laravel. If you want to know more about this time then...

                    h3  What I can give
                    p   I'm able to start web application projects from scratch using the most common and newest frameworks like Angular, React and ViuJS. I like JsUniteTesting, Github workflows and process automation such as gulp, grunt and webpack. No need for a big GUI for coding. The only thing I need is Atom, SublimeText or VSCode. I also like TypeScript or ES6 a lot. I know how to make responsive UI's with Bootstrap but I'm also able to use plain HTML5 and CSS3... So lets get started!

                    h3  What I want
                    p   The "what I want" is easy, "Its gaining" is complicated. I'm not a absolute guy, but it would be nice to work in a scrum-a-like workflow using team. I'm able to work alone if its needed, but I prefer to be part of a team. If there is a new approach in the frontend scene I would like to learn and share my knownledge by visiting workshops or conferences. I also like to stay near Frankfurt.

                    h3  What else is there?
                    p   Since Dec. 2017 I'm proud to be the father of the most beautiful daughter in th world. I'm married with a powerpuff girl. She is a really tuff and lovely woman. Beside this I'm a hobby game developer and portrait artist as well. I like electronic music and I'm a big fan of sports cars... dreaming about to own a Lamborgini Aventator GT ...
