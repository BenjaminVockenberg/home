                    | in Frankfurt, Germany. I'm doing Internet stuff since 2007 as I leared how much fun it is to get things moved into the WWW and earning money with it. 
                    
                p   I made a lot of good experiences at the advertising companies I was working for. Mostly as web and web-developer using all kinds of web based programing languages... 
                
                p Soon I learned how to create web applications using the newest technologies like 
                    strong HTML5, CSS3, Angular 
                    | and a tiny little bit Laravel. If you want to know more about this time then...

                p   I'm able to start web app projects from scratch using modern frameworks like 
                    strong Angular, React and VueJS. 
                    | I like unit testing, Git and process automation such as gulp and webpack. I also like TypeScript and ES6 a lot. I know how to make responsive websites and apps with or without frameworks.

                p I like Javascript because it is best for learning and using functional programming. The features of ES6 are awesome. But in order to create big scaled web applications It is good to know you can count on lots of helping hands. Framesworks can handle lots of stuff you would have take care of by your self. There are many frameworks out there, but I prefer using Angular for more complex applications and VueJs for more or less simpler projects.
