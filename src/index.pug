                    strong Angular, React and VueJS. 
                    | I like unit testing, Git and process automation such as gulp and webpack. I also like TypeScript and ES6 a lot. I know how to make responsive websites and apps with or without frameworks.

                p I love Javascript because it is best for learning and using functional programming. The features of ES6 are awesome. But in order to create big scaled web applications It is good to know you can count on lots of helping hands. Framesworks can handle lots of stuff you would have take care of by your self. There are many frameworks out there, but I prefer using Angular for more complex applications and VueJs for more or less simpler projects.

                p Many people are using the framework for each project, cause they are happy to do so. But I love to have the possibility to have a more lightweight framework for more lightweight a like Projects. Vue is the best choice for smaller applications. Some people would ask now: 
                    span what about React'n'stuff? 
                    | Yeah React is cool, but I prefer to keep my smaller projects as simple as possible. If you never took a look to Vue, you definitely should do so.

                p   A better and more modern approach of process automation. It handles all your needs and you can focus more on being productive! Its most beein used in modern frameworks like AngularCLI and VueCLI. For those who're using Angular you can use it with no configuration!

            h2 Curriculum Vitae

            article.layout75

                h3 It's my life!

                p I was born in 1981 in Bad Hersfeld, Germany. What a year, so many new things to learn!

                p X-mas 1986 my cousin bought a Atari 2600 console with Pitfall and Frogger. YES!

                p In 1989 I got my first computer. A C64 with a Diskdrive and a DataSette. This changed my life in a way my parents could not imagine. I started to do my Homework with this machine. I used VisaWrite for writing texts and basic Basic to do math! My German Teacher was not happy with it... because My handwriting was in a bad shape.. So They told my parents to watch me doing my homework by hand. My math teacher was fascinated by my basic skills and he motivated me to continue doing so. We talked a lot about programming during school breaks. It was fun!

                p In 1991 I wa introduced to the school IT working group. It was a voluntary lessons taking place in the afternoon. I was proud to be part of it. I learned to use Pascal as a new programming language on an IBM XT. There I met my best friends for the first time. Real nerds!

                p In 1994 after my confirmation I saved enough money (confirmation presents, paperboy and my grandparents) to buy my own first PC. It was a Pentium 100 with 8 MB Ram, a QuadSpeed CD-ROM a Soundblaster AWE32 and a Vesa-Graphics card... There was only DOS 6.22 and Windown 3.11 installed. I was still interessed in programming but it was much more fun this time playing games like Doom, Monkey Island and SimCity. I had my first LAN-Party not much later the same year! Great!

                p 1999 I changed to a professional high school for economic computer science. It was boring as hell. The only lesson I loved was the Pascal-Class and the Network-laboratory-Class. Most of my school mates were cool and nice people but my old nerd friends were missing. So I met the wrong guys and fought trough all the others lessons teh be gratuated.

                p Then right after leaving school I knew that the time was still not right to go work every day. So I signed up for computer science studies. What a waste of time. I better should have taken the job at B. Braun as Application developer.

                p In 2007 I canceled my studies and started to work for an advertisement company as a Webdesigner in Frankfurt. It was a good Idea and still this day, I'm doing web developement. I love it.

                p After the Company closed in 2012 I changed to another company working for the Messe Frankfurt. There I learned much about creating web based applications. In order to that I created web based tools for the Messe Frankfurt. One of those tools were build for selling boothes for the following fairs. Salesmen were using their Ipads to go to threir customers and place their orders directly. The App were using modern HTML5 and CSS3, so we could get use of modern browser technologies like browser storage, Offline mode and much more! For a special case (Farir in Italy)we build an App for Android via PhoneGap.
                
                p Time passes and I wanted a change of view again. So I left this Company and started 2016 as Frontend-Dev in a Company thats is well known as a fast growing ticketing company in Germany.
                
                p Still here and still happy :)
