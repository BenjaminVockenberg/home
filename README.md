## a portfolio website

This is a simple website project I created a long time ago. Originally it was meant to be a portfolio site. Now it is more like a testing area. After I deleted the www.psychomonster.com I needed another proof of existence. With this website I'll keep track of my skills and projects I'm workin on.

It still needs a functionally navigation but this is in progress. 

## Changes

- I switched from jquery to VueJs for testing my PhraseGenerator build with another lib.

- I Switched from VueJs to AngularJS 1.6.9 for testing my PhraseGenerator in a legacy framework.

- Implemented unit testing with jest for continous integration with circleCi.

  - Jest test suit is up and running

  - even with angularjs Controller, Services and Factories

- Implemented ESlint for keeping track of the coding style
