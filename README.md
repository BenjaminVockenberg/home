This is a simple website project I created a long time ago. Originally it was meant to be a portfolio site. Now it is more like a testing area. 

in this last version I switched from jquery to angularJS 1.1.6 for testing legacy stuff for a project at work.

switching to vueJS soon!

Implemented unit testing with jest for continous integration with circleCi. Testsuit is installed. First testing tests are running perfectly. Now linking github workflow with circle CI.

Next topic: finding out how to test angularJs controller with jest ...
